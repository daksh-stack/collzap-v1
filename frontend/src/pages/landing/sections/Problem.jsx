/**
 * A hostel notice board where nobody has torn off a single tab.
 *
 * Every note carries the fringe of pull-tabs you see on a real campus board,
 * and every fringe is intact — which is the section's argument in one image:
 * plenty of people asking, none of them reached. That is why the tabs are
 * drawn as perforations rather than decoration; the point is that they are
 * uncut.
 *
 * It replaces a hand-drawn SVG "corridor" that did not survive contact with a
 * real screen: the perspective lines met mid-frame and read as a bowtie, the
 * doors floated free of any wall, and the lone student was a circle on a dome.
 *
 * The paper stays colour-literal in both themes — paper does not change colour
 * when the lights go off — and carries no brand accent. The gradient is saved
 * for the sections that answer this one.
